All notable changes to this project will be documented in
this [changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/0.3.0/).
This project adheres to Semantic Versioning.

## Unreleased
### Added
### Changed
### Fixed

## 2.4.5.3
### Added
- Create a Remote Monitoring Registration custom event #5080
- Add support for HL7 SIU appointment messages #5091
- Add support for HL7 admissions #5090
- Display patient appointments on their clinic visits page #5097
- Allow for display of configured external links eg QlickSense) on Logon and dashboard… #5102
- Support loading Index of Multiple Deprivation database tables for use in analysis #5108
- Add a letter_snomed_document_types table #5117
  - A letter topic can be assigned a snomed_document_type, which will be used in GP Connect FHIR
  messages as Bundle.documentType. If the letter topic has no assigned snomed_document_type,
  the snomed_document_type with a boolean default_type=true (of which there can be only one due
  to unique index) will be used.
- Fetch and display Mirth queue stats (e.g. processed and errored counts) on a superadmin dashboard #5161
### Changed
- Update SQL fn that opts patients into renalreg based on egfr #5070
  - Use fn prototype variant convert_to_float(val, null) to return null where egfr cannot be
    coerced into a string eg '>60'. The current form convert_to_float(val) returns 0 for strings
- Offer vaccines filtered by ATC code when adding Vaccination event #5082
- Refresh prescribable_drugs materialised view after a drug edit #5098
- Include 'UNK' SDS code for all users in the FHIR Practitioner resource
- Add ods_code column to hospital_units #5137
- Capture email and up to two telephone numbers from HL7 PID #5152
- Import HL7 marital_status if available #5153
- Add versioning to clinic appointments #5154
- Allow a host app to override clinic resolution in outpatient HL7 message processing #5160
### Fixed
- Fix validation on OnlineReferenceLink#url #5086
  - Only validate the url starts with https:// or http:// and do not attempt to regex the whole url

## 2.4.5.2
### Added
### Changed
- Use a pathology code group to define hep_b_antibody_statuses OBX codes #5066
  - Rather than the previous implementation which was an ENV variable which is harder to change and less in keeping with our approach elsewhere. Code group name is 'hep_b_antibody_statuses'.
- On death modality deactivate HD profile if they have one #5065
  Rather than superseding with a new amended one with hospital unit and schedule nulled-out.
### Fixed

## 2.4.5.1
### Added
### Changed
- Supersede (deactivate old and create new) HD profile on death modality rather than directly update HD Profile #5036
  - Previously on death modality the patient's current hd_profile was updated to null-out hospital_unit and schedule_definition. This was the wrong approach and we should instead deactivate the current profile and create a new one with those nulled values. This way makes it easier to find what unit a patient was at before they died.
- Add configuration so non-admins can update PKB/RR settings #5039
- Mark letter and associated MESH transmission as failed on timeout #5033
  - If no bus or inf response received with the configured period, set transmission.status = failed and the letter.gp_sent_status = failed
- Retry on SaveRTFLetterToFileJob on Errno::EPIPE (broken pipe) errors #5004
  - BLT RTF rendering occasional error
- Allow a superadmin to delete events even if they have been sent to EPR as a PDF #4994
- Re-arrange Tx Wait List Registration form #4997
  - Move WL Status to the top (only appears in new record)
  - Move Organs section under it
- Add a from..to date for automatically including QR codes in letters #4974
  - If an OnlineReferenceLink (which becomes a QR code when inserted into a letter) has #include_in_letters_from and #include_in_letters_from dates that satisfy conditions, that QR code is automatically added to any new letters.
### Fixed
- Mesh ITK error eg 30003 was not setting letter.gp_send_status=failure #5043
- Mark letter and associated MESH transmission as failed on timeout #5033
- Use sending facility name in IDN07 rather than site code #5040
- Supersede rather than directly update HD Profile on death modality #5036
  - Previously on death modality the patient's current hd_profile was updated to null-out hospital_unit and schedule_definition. This was the wrong approach and we should instead deactivate the current profile and create a new one with those nulled values. This way makes it easier to find what unit a patient was at before they died.
- Fix HD Diary slot creation issue #5014
  - If scope was the first one in the dropdown eg 'Dialysing Monday Eve' then after choosing a patient and clicking 'Add to this and all future weeks', the patient was only added to the Weekly diary not the Master one. This was because some javascript in the diary slot form had not executed when the modal loaded.
- Fix bug filtering HD Slot requests by patient name #5007
- Fix error creating a new HD Session that has PGDs assigned #5003
  - Applies only when creating a new HD Session, adding one or more patient group directions (PGDs), and then clicking 'Create' or 'Save and Signoff'. Editing an existing session add adding PGDs at that point is not affected.

## 2.4.5
### Added
- Allow editing bookmarks #4940
- Display a Deleted letters tab for superadmin users #4909
- Add unique IDN07 Renal Registry id to patients #4927
  - autogenerated unique 10 char string
  - allow searching on this id

  - Mirth version
  - Mirth java version
- Allow adding snippets to HD Session notes #4936
- Add external_reference column to research participations #4892
  - And allow this to be manually entered on creation/edit. This differs from external_id in that the latter is automatically generated (pseudo-anonymised for reverse lookup if required) and not editable.
### Changed
- Reorganisation of research, hospitals, and contacts (directory) folders, so these need some brief testing #4895
- Only an admin can update RReg and KB preferences #4925
- Update PD MDM Patients SQL view - Add POT and POT date, Add filters for hospital_centre, named nurse and named consultant #4912
- Capture malignancy site and diabetes type in comorbidities #4896
- Only an admin can update RReg and KB preferences #4925
- Store OBX.11 Observation Result Status #4939
  - Store the results status (eg P=Preliminary, F=Final) so that we can give precedence to Final results when displaying. Since a recent change to use OBR date for for the OBX values (rather than OBX observed_at), we need a better way of filtering out preliminary results which might say eg 'Sent to Lab'; a subsequent OBX with results_status of F=Final will arrive with the correct value, and we do not want the P result to obscure the F one.
- Upcase address.postcode on save #4964
- Conditionally validate the presence of HD Session PGDs if HD_SESSION_REQUIRE_PATIENT_GROUP_DIRECTIONS=true #4966
- Update demographics on HL7 ADT^A05 message #4965

### Fixed

- Handle non-Windows-1252 characters in PDF address cover sheet #4923
