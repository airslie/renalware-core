  prefix eg `app:ukrdc`

Any xml files in the folder `<UKRDC_WORKING_PATH>/incoming`  will imported. `UKRDC_WORKING_PATH`
is an environment variable that can be configured in the relevant `.env` file.
Processed files will be copied to `<UKRDC_WORKING_PATH>/archive/incoming` and will need to be
periodically cleared.
