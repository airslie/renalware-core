# Accessibility statement for Renalware

This accessibility statement applies to the Renalware web application when used within NHS Trusts.

This web application is run by Airslie Ltd. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this web application.
For example, that means you should be able to:

- change colours, contrast levels and fonts
- zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen
- navigate most of the website using just a keyboard
- navigate most of the website using speech recognition software
- listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)

We’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.
[AbilityNet](https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/) has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.

## How accessible this website is

We know some parts of this website are not fully accessible:

- some PDF documents are not fully accessible to screen reader software
- some of our online forms are difficult to navigate using just a keyboard
- you cannot skip to the main content when using a screen reader

## Reporting accessibility problems with this website

We’re always looking to improve the accessibility of the site.
If you find any problems not listed on this page or think we’re not meeting accessibility requirements, please contact dev@airslie.com.

## Enforcement procedure

The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for enforcing the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 (the ‘accessibility regulations’). If you’re not happy with how we respond to your complaint, contact the Equality Advisory and Support Service (EASS).

# Technical information about this website’s accessibility

Airslie Ltd is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.

## Compliance status

This website is partially compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard, due to the non-compliances and exemptions listed below.

# Non-accessible content

The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.

## Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations

- there are some missing form labels
- there are some empty form labels
- there are some empty links
- there are some empty table headers
- there are some contrast issues with links in tables

## Disproportionate burden

### Navigation and accessing information

- There’s no way to skip the repeated content in the page header (for example, a ‘skip to main content’ option).
- It’s not always possible to change the device orientation from horizontal to vertical without making it more difficult to view the content.
- It’s not possible for users to change text size without some of the content overlapping.
- Some of our interactive forms are difficult to navigate using a keyboard. For example, because some form controls are missing a ‘label’ tag.

### Data entry

We’ve assessed the cost of fixing the issues with navigation and accessing information. We believe that doing so now would be a
[disproportionate](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/952/regulation/7/made) burden within the meaning of the accessibility regulations.
We will make another assessment within a year of the date of preparation of this statement.
