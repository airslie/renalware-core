## Perspectives

Perspectives are a 'view' onto a patient from a certain angle eg bone, anaemia, or
blood pressure. They are similar to MDMs in that they aggregate patient data, but they do it
in a more focused and less multidisciplinary way.

Currently perspectives pages are mostly hard-coded, but eventually could be data driven.
