    # PET and Adequacy are two distinct, descrete PD tests.
    # The function of this unified PET + Adequacy controller is to provide the functionality for
    # a user to add the data for both at the same time.
    # This is because
    # a) users tend to regard the tests as 'lumped-together' (even though they aren't), and
    # b) both tests are often done at the same time, so a unified form saves some time and effort.
    #
    # Note that we never edit a unified PET + Adequacy; as they create separate rows in the db
    # and are separate models, once created they are treated distinctly. This is mainly because
    # the processing of the tests is quicte different.
    # See pet.rb and adequacy.rb for more detail.
