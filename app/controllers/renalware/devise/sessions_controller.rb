    # Define the path to go to after logging in:
    # - if the user has never before logged-in, devise will take them to the root path (dashboard)
    # - if the user's session timed-out less that 30 minutes ago, we take them back to the
    #    last page they were on.
    # - if the user's session timed-out more than 30 minutes ago, we take them back to the
    #    their dashboard. See PR #1592 for rationale.
    # - if the user has explicitly logged-out they will always go the the dashboard path on login,
    #   regardless of how long ago they signed out, because in this instance devise removes it's
    #   entries in the session cookie.
