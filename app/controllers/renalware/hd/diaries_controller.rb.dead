# The route to the edit route for this controller takes /:year/:week_number segments
# rather than an id. THat is because when we load the diary, and when we navigate back and forth
# through diaries, we are concerned with the week more then an id. Its easier to navigate to the
# next week with /2017/52 than by looking up the id of the next diary ahead of time.
