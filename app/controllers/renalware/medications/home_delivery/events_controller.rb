        # A major REST faux pas, our #new action actually creates something - an instance of a
        # HomeDelivery::Event. We use this to render a modal form where the user can choose which
        # drug types they want to print a PDF for, and what some parameters are for the PDF
        # e.g. the prescription duration. See also Drugs::HomecareForm.
        # The overall idea is that when you bring up the modal dialog to print a home delivery PDF
        # there is always an Event object created behind it, and when you change the params (drug
        # type, prescription duration) it updates the stored event, ready for printing.
        # Although this means we might create rows that are never printed if the user cancels out
        # of the dialog, this is OK as the #printed flag will not be set on those rows so they can
