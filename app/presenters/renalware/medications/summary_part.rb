      # The cache key here must be such that a change to any prescription or its associated
      # drug (including a reclassification of drug_type e.g. changing from ESA to immunosuppressant
      # or a change in the drug name) will invalidate the cache for this patient's prescriptions.
      # So we build a composite cache_key based on prescriptions and their drugs.
      # Note we rely on an a couple of things here:
      # - an after_remove callback in Drug -> Classification to set updated_at on the drug; removing
      #   classifications uses a delete not a destroy so otherwise would not touch the parent drug.
      # - adding a drug classification to a drug (e.g. making a drug ESA) touches the drug and this
      #   generates a new cache_key here
      # - note that although adding `belongs_to :prescription, touch: true` to Drug would solve
      #   our cache validation here, that would mean knowing the Drugs module knowing about the
      #   Prescriptions module, when currently only the reverse is acceptable (i.e.
      #   Prescriptions -> Drugs)
      def cache_key
        # Based on AR::Relation.cache_key, this key incorporates the following, scoped to the
        # current patient:
        # - max(prescriptions.updated)
        # - count(prescriptions)
        # - max(drug.updated_at) in drugs across all prescriptions
        # - count(drugs) across all prescriptions (same as prescriptions.count so not really
        #   required, but comes for free with AR::Relation.cache_key)
