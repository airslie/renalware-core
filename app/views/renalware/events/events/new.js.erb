// Insert inputs (if any) specific to the EventType the user has selected.
// For example if the user selects a 'Renal Biopsy' event type in the 'new event' form
// then we should insert some extra fields to capture biopsy-specific data.
// We do this by rendering the event's partial the name of which is specified by the event class
// in #to_partial_path.
// Note in order to get form error validations to wire up nicely, we need a SimpleFormBuilder
// or more correctly we need to be inside a simple_form_for block. Note the quotes around the
// simple_form_for code here ensure the content is not rendered, but the erb tags
// still means the ruby is interpreted and the block and its argument f are available!
