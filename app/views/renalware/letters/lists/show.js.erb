// After a user has printed a letter and chosen Yes to
// mark the Letter as printed, we will have made a POST to completed_letters
// to set the letter status and completed_letters/create.js.erb will then load.
// It looks for a URL to use to refresh the letter page content (see that partial)
// and makes an AJAX get to that URL. This is the template for that AJX get call.
// We close the print confirmation dialog and and refresh the letter table content.
