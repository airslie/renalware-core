// We have just 'created' a Letter Completion resource on the server
// (in other words we have updated the letter state to Completed!) and now we
// need to refresh the view the user was on. This could be any page
// were the letter is listed or displayed. So look for a URL stored
// somewhere on the page in a data attribute and if found make an AJAX call
// which will probably reload e.g. a letters table or something like that.
