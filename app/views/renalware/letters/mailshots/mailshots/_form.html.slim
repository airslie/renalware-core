      markdown:
        The list of patients to include in a mailshot it determined by the SQL View chosen above.
        It is intended that a systems or database administrator create this view for you in the
        renalware database. The view should have one column called 'patient_id' and return the ids
        of all the patients you want to send this letter to.

        You should ideally create the view in the hospital's
        own postgres schema (eg 'renalware_kch' in the case of Kings College Hospital) in order to
        indicate your view is hospital-specific.

        **Note that in order for your view to appear in the dropdown above, its name must start
        with `letter_mailshot_`**

        Here is a (somewhat pointless) example of a compatible SQL view definition:

        ```
          CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW
          renalware_kch.letter_mailshot_patients_where_surname_starts_with_r AS
          SELECT id as patient_id
          FROM patients
          WHERE family_name like 'R%';
        ```
