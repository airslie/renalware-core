        / Note we wrap the Part instance in an array here. This is because the Part
        / delegates to its underling problems array, so it is itself 'array-like'.
        / The render(object) call below ignores any #to_partial_path method on object if
        / object is an array and instead only calls to_partial_path (if found) on array elements.
        / So, in order for the to_partial_path to get called on the array-like Parts::Problems,
        / we need to wrap it an array. We also use the 'render Part' approach when rendering
        / a formatted letters, but the LetterPresenter has an array of parts anyway (with parts
        / for problems, prescriptions, contacts) etc - so this problem is already handled there.
