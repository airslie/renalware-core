          .block.mb-4 AKI Alerts are generated when an AKI score (1, 2 or 3) is received from the lab. The logic for creating AKI alerts is:
          .block.mt-4 if patient age > 16 and current modality is not HD, PD or Death
          .block.pl-4 when AKI score = 1
          .block.pl-8 alert if no alert within 14 days with any score (1,2,3)
          .block.pl-4 when score is 2 or 3
          .block.pl-8 alert if no alert in past 14 days
          .block.pl-8 alert if only score in previous 14 days was for a score of 1
          .block.pl-8 do not alert if alert in past 14 days was for a score of either 2 or 3
