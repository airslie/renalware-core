/ On the devise login page we want flash messages to appear as fixed text next to the username
/ and password fields so its immediately obvious to the user what the problem is - rather than
/ as text at the page top (as we used to do) or as a toast (as we are moving towards elsewhere
/ in the app. To this end we define an empty :flash_messages content block to prevent the default
/ (toast) implementation from appearing when there are flash messages (see application.html.slim)
/ and later on in this file render our own instance of FlashMessagesComponent, asking it not to
/ use toast.
