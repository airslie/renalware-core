module Renalware
  module Events
    # A generic view component for displaying a summarised list of events of a certain
    # type - for example Biopsy events - to add to a dashboard or MDM.
    # Once we have configurable dashboards and MDMs it should be possible to
    # drop this component onto a dashboard and configure the event class and perhaps
    # some other custom parameters, and at run time the dashboard is constructed
    # and will include the requested component. In this way you could choose to
    # add say list components which each display a different class of event.
    # Obviously some more thought needs to go into this but as a direction of
    # travel it has many advantages - for example a hospital can configure the default
    # dashboards and MDMs, perhaps depending on the user's role, but an individual user
    # could override and build their own.
    # Some parameters to think about when configuring an event component
    # - event class or description - where does the event_type fit in?
    # - the AR scope to use and whether this affects sorting
    # - the title displayed above the list of events - is this i18n, derived from the
    #   event type/class, or configured when the dashboard is designed?
    # - to what extent to the event partials affect display? We have these to help us
    #   build form inputs and display content in table cell/toggled cells, but is this flexible
    #   enough - e.g. is only have a Description HTML table column sufficient for displaying
    #   multiple custom event properties (defined in the event's document) or do we need to allow
    #   partials that control table structure?
    #
    # Perhaps a datavase-backed component configuration model could be passed into this component to
    # drive the display - eg hide_if_no_data of not.
