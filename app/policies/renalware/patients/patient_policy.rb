        # Here we filter out patients that the current user should not be able to see - for example
        # if patients are in a private clinical study etc.
        # The need for this policy scope arose from work on the HEROIC clinical study, where there
        # were 2 sites using the same instance of Renalware - RL (the host site), and RF.
        # The specific patient access requirements for HEROIC, which now apply to all similar
        # 'private' studies, are as follows:
        #
        #   RF HEROIC user - sees HEROIC patients at RF and RL, and all non-HEROIC patients at RF
        #   RL HEROIC user - sees HEROIC patients at RL and RF and all non-HEROIC patients at RL
        #   RF non-HEROIC user - sees all non-HEROIC patients at RF
        #   RL non-HEROIC user - sees all patients at RL including HEROIC patient
