# When executed this job updates rolling statistics for a patient's
# last past 12 HD sessions.
# Because this job will be triggered again the next time an HD Sessions is
# created, it is not crucial to keep each event around - ie they have a short
# shelf-life. For this reason we only retry 3 times then delete failed jobs.
