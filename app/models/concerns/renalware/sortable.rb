    # Assumes that the model has the #position attribute and adds 2 features to a model that
    # includes it:
    # 1. Set the :position to the next highest value when a new row is added. If the model has a
    #    position_sorting_scope scope or class method, this is used to narrow the range of records
    #    searched when finding the current max position
    # 2. Add ability to sort rows based on an array of ids.

    # Invoked by the callback when a record is created to set the initial value of #position.
    # If no position_sorting_scope is defined on the model class, we set position to the max
    # position in the whole table. If position_sorting_scope is provided we use it to refine the
    # grouping and hence the max(position) found - for example to get the max position where
    # patient_id = 123

    #   scope :position_sorting_scope, ->(problem) { where(patient_id: problem.patient.id) }
