# frozen_string_literal: true

# Uses acts_as_paranoid to implement a means of deactivating an old and activating a
# new object such that there can only be one active object
# Enforcing only one active object requires an appropriate unique index to be created
# See https://github.com/rubysherpas/paranoia#unique-indexes
# Example migration:
#    add_column :hd_profiles, :deactivated_at, :datetime, index: true
#    add_column :hd_profiles, :active, :boolean, null: true, default: true
#    add_index :hd_profiles, [:active, :patient_id], unique: true
