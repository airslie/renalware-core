    # Calculates a patients age. Takes into account:
    # - if they have a died_on date, in which case their age never changes
    # - which side of 'today' their birthday (e.g. May 11) falls, to make sure
    #   their age is for example only 99 and not 100 when their birthday is 100 years ago tomorrow,
    #   and 100 when its is 100 years ago today or yesterday.
    #
    # Example usage:
    #
    #   CalculateAge.for(patient) #=> 99
    #
