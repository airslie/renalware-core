# A generic patient search that returns an AR relation that can used directly or merged into other
# queries if required in order to use the extensive patient search criteria added by the
# `identity_match` ransacker. See also a corresponding Patients::SearchForm form object and its
# partial.
#
# Example usage to find letters relating to any patient with rabbit in their surname:
#   Letter
#     .joins(:patients)
#     .merge(
#       Patients::SearchQuery.new(term: "rabbit").call
#     )
