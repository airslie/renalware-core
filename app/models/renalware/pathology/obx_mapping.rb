      # Here we need to resolve exactly one ObservationDescription for a given
      # code eg 'HB' and sender (SendingFacility/SendingApplication from the HL7 MSH).
      # The sender has already been found/created and passed to us so we don't
      # need to worry about that.
      # What we need to do is to workout if the incoming code eg 'HB' exists in the obx_mapping
      # table for the current sender - this mechanism will let us accept eg 'HB' and map to the HGB
      # observation_description. Mostly there won't be an obx_mapping entry, but if there is
      # one, we return the mapped observation_description, otherwise return a direct match
      # against ObservationDescription code.
      #
      # Here is an example:
      #
      # incoming_code alias  SendingFacility SendingApplication  maps_to
      # HBN           HBN    Facility1       *                   => HGB
      # HB            HB     Facility1       *                   => HGB
      # HGB                                                      => HGB

        #   might as after all we create missing OBX codes automatically..) then
