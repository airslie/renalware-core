    # A custom relation-like object, implementing a kaminari-like pagination interface.
    # Its a query object but means to be used like a relation. If passed into a view you can
    # do = paginate(relation).
    # See ObservationsGroupedByDateTable for intended usage.
    #
    # .all() returns a jsonb hash of OBX results for each day a patient had an observation.
    # Only returns observations whose code matches observation_descriptions
    #
    # Example usage:
    #   observation_descriptions = ..
    #   rows = ObservationsGroupedByDateQuery.new(
    #     patient: patient,
    #     observation_descriptions: observation_descriptions,
    #     per_page: 50,
    #     page: 1
    #   )
    #
    # Example output:
    #   patient_id  observation_date  observations
