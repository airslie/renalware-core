      # feed_messages with the same MD5 body_hash (the message is identical to one already saved)
      # resulting in unique key violation.
      # Using a transaction here prevents any orphaned records if there is an error.
      # However we should be aware that any listeners raising an error will prevent successful
      # in all other listeners. So a listener should be careful to catch errors and not re-raise
      # them, or use the :message_processed message (lower down) which is safer.
