    # This model captures the point when a request is made (eg programmatically when a patient is
    # added due to an AKI alert or Clinic Appointment HL7 message) to replay historical pathology
    # for a patient and we reference the id of this model in each MessageReplay (along with the
    # feed_message_id). Here we also ensure there is no other ongoing replay for a patient.
    # Scenario:
    #  - HL7 msg A arrives - its a clinic appt and the patient is not in RW so it creates them
    #  - it spawns a job to find and import hist path in case we have any for them.
    #  - That job kicks off and starts importing pathology. Lets say it takes 1 minute.
    #  - Before its finished, another HL7 message arrives for the same patient. However as the
    #    patient is already in RW they are not created and no hist path job is spawned.
    #  - so there is limited scope for a race condition and multiple replay requests for the same
    #    patient, but we do log and quit if there is previous unfinished replay.
    #    On the whole, as long as each MessageReplay is idempotent then there is no issue.
