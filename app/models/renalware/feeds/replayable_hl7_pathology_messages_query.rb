    # When a new patient is added to Renalware, its possible and likely we will have received
    # HL7 messages for them at some point in the past given that we store all ADT (demographics)
    # and ORU (pathology) messages for all patients in the hospital, routed via our Mirth server.
    # So it would be nice to replay a patient's historical messages, but this time, instead of
    # ignoring their content because the patient is not in Renalware, they will be imported and
    # associated with the patient.
    #
    # This query object finds feed_messages that
    # - relate to the supplied patient
    # - have not been imported yet
    # and replays them.
    # We can in theory replay ADT or ORU messages but currently do only ORU (pathology) because it
    # it is deemed that once the patient is added to Renalware, subsequent ADT HL7 messages which
    # will soon arrive will being the demographic data up to date - so no point replaying ADT
    # messages really (although appointment info could be useful?), and might in fact lead to
    # confusion.
    #
    # We also take into account previous replays and and do not import a messages if has a row in a
    # 'replayed messages' table where success was indicated.
