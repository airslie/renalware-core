# Builds a new MessageForm form object. MessageForm is used behind the html form when displaying a
# `Send Message` Dialog the first time. Note that we don't use this builder again on e.g.
# form submission - at that point all the required params are in the form payload - this is
# only for the initial MesageForm creation.
