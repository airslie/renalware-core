# Builds grouped drop down options for potential private message recipients.
# The groups are:
# - users who have recently received a message about the current patient
# - users who have recently received a message from the current author (excluding those already
#   listed in the above group)
# - all remaining users
#
# We work with arrays of user ids so we can easily order build the distinct lists.
# There might be a more efficient or clearer way to do.
