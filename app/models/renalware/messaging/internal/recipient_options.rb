# Builds grouped drop down options for potential private message recipients.
# The groups are:
# - users who have recently received a message about the current patient
# - users who have recently received a message from the current author (excluding those already
#   listed in the above group)
# - all remaining users
#
# The author is excluded from all lists so they cannot send to themselves
