          # The way I understand Ransack is that if you use a query like profile_esrf_gt
          # (that's the RenalProfile in this case as we are dealing with a Renal::Patient)
          # it will do the left out join itself onto renal_profiles.
          # At one point I did a manual join onto renal_profiles here like this
          # .joins("LEFT OUTER JOIN renal_profiles ON renal_profiles.patient_id = patients.id")
          # but that only worked when there was no search predicate passed; when you pass eg
          # profile_esrf_gt it joins onto renal_profiles again and you get a duplicate join.
          # However using left_outer_joins here somehow prevents a duplicate join;
          # one join onto renal_profiles is there whether there is a renal_profile_esrf_gt present
          # or not. However it ONLY works if you use left_outer_joins BEFORE calling .ransack
          # - calling it afterwards (in #call below) still results in a duplicate join IF
          # renal_profile_esrf_gt is present in the query.
          #
          # I have to say, ransack eats up a lot of time and presents a lot of cognitive friction.
          # Building a custom form object would have shaved an hour off the writing (mainly
          # debugging) of this code.
          #
          # Update: moved loading of profile to #call.
          # Having it in #default_relation leads to a duplicate alias if sorting on esrf for
          # instance. Having to use .eager_load(:profile) in #call. However this creates n+1
          # queries. Ransack again creating more confusion...
