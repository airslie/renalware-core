      # doing some magic for us; as long as we have an array of electronic_cc_recipients in the
      # params, it will add/remove an associated electronic_receipt object for us (assigning the
      # letter_id to them in the process), because we used
      #   has_many :electronic_cc_recipients, through: :electronic_receipts
      # However, here, as we have no letter.id (letter is unsaved), Rails cannot yet create the
      # implied electronic_receipt object for each electronic_cc_recipient for us - we must do it
      # ourselves using electronic_receipts.build so rails will update the letter id in each when
      # the parent letter is saved.

      # Here we are doing two things:
      #
      # 1 We overwrite the ActiveRecord-generated 'electronic_cc_recipient_ids' property that would,
      #   if any electronic_cc_recipients where saved against the letter, return the ids of those
      #   recipients. This property is used in the letter form when displaying the selected eCC
      #   users in a multi-select list. It works as expected when editing
      #   letters that have a saved set of eCC recipients. But for the case when we are creating a
      #   new letter, where there are no saved eCC recipients BUT we want to *pre-select* zero or
      #   more default eCCs, overwriting this property lets us spoof what AR would have done but
      #   instead of returning user ids resolved through the AR relationship (which would require
      #   those records to be saved) we return our own array. More on this next...
      #
      # 2 Inside our replacement #electronic_cc_recipient_ids property we resolve (collate, gather)
      #   the complete set of default eCC users (as an array of user ids) and return them.
      #   This lets us pre-select the default eCCs in the eCC multi-select
      #   UI component in the new letter form. The array of user ids is resolved by raising an
      #   event and asking any listeners to add in their eCC suggestions.
