# frozen_string_literal: true

# A Diary is the schedule of HD Station/Patients assignments for one week for a particular unit.
# A Diary is split into Periods (eg. am pm eve), and each Period has a matrix of slots
# Imagine Days eg 1 to 6 on the X axis and Stations on the Y axis, and into each 'slot' we
# put a patient.
# A patient can only be in one slot in any period.
#
# Do not create instances of this class explicitly, always use the STI sub classes eg MasterDiary.
