      # A form object used to display and capture the HD Session start and stop dates and times.
      # From the UI perspective there is:
      # - start_date (aka performed_on) which is the date dialysis started
      # - start_time eg 11:00 (stored as a Time for convenience but displayed as a string)
      # - end_time eg 13:00
      # - overnight_dialysis - a boolean which when checked by the user allows them to choose an
      #   end_date before the start time
      # These map into the database as
      # - started_at datetime
      # - stopped_at datetime (the date might be day after started_at if overnight_dialysis = true)
      #
      # We assign a duration_form instance to the HD::Session when displaying the session form UI.
      # If displaying a new session, the dates and times will be empty.
      # If editing an existing session, the duration_form_for(session) factory method will
      # set the attributes according to the started_at and stopped_at attributes on the session.
