      # Rather than using a Ransack Search object behind the form, as we do in many other places
      # here we use a custom form object. This is mainly because we have a drop down of (virtual)
      # statues, where each maps to a scope on Inpatient, where we want the selected 'status'
      # to result in its associated scope being called. Ransack doesn't handle this, not
      # surprisingly. So we have this thin form object around Ransack and do some pre-processing
      # on the Status attribute (see #status_scope).

        # so as to avoid unnecessary code here, though the magic obfuscates things a little...

        # If a status was selected in the drop down, map this to a ransack way of saying
        # "call this scope on Inpatient", which is to pass the following (note the true
        # which indicates the scope should be used):
        #
        #   { name_of_scope: true }
