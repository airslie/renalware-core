      # Broadcast (using Wisper) an event to indicate the patient's current modality has changed,

      # modality changes to Death.

      # by configuring Renalware.config.broadcast_subscription_map. Be careful to append to rather
      # than replace the default entries in the hash map.
      # For example in a your applications config/initializers/renalware_core.rb, add:
      #  Renalware.configure do |config|
      #   map = config.broadcast_subscription_map
      #   map["Renalware::Modalities::ChangePatientModality"] << "SomeNamespace::SomeListenerClass"

      # When broadcasting events, if the event description has a #.to_sym e.g :hd or :death
      # then we use that in the name of the event, e.g. `patient_modality_changed_to_death`.
      # We also broadcast the previous modality in the event name when present, e.g.
      # `patient_modality_changed_from_pd`, for subscribers that care about what the patient is
      # leaving rather than what they are moving to.
      # Otherwise, for more generic events we use `patient_modality_changed`.
      # I'm not sure this is a very consistent approach so may need to revisit.
