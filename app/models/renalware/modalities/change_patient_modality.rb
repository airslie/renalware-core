      #    .new(patient: patient, user: curret_user)
      #    .call(

      #       started_on: Time.zone.now

      # Broadcast (using Wisper) an event to indicate the patient's current modality has changed,
      # This allows classes in other modules/parts of the application to take appropriate action.
      # For example the Letters module may want to terminate all patient prescriptions if the
      # modality changes to Death.
      #
      # The list of subscribers/listeners who will receive the message is set in the Broadcasting
      # module which we mix in above _proveided_ the caller has chained the

      # If you wish to add more listeners and these are site/hospital-specific, this can be done
      # by configuring Renalware.config.broadcast_subscription_map. Be careful to append to rather
      # than replace the default entries in the hash map.
      # For example in a your applications config/initalizers/renalware_core.rb, add:
      #  Renalware.configure do |config|
      #   map = config.broadcast_subscription_map
      #   map["Renalware::Modalities::ChangePatientModality"] << "SomeNamespace::SomeListenerClass"

      # When broadcasting events, if the event description has a #.to_sym e.g :hd or :death
      # then we use that in the name of the event, e.g. `patient_modality_changed_to_death`.
      # Otherwise, for more generic events we use `patient_modality_changed`.
      # I'm not sure this is a very consistent approach so may need to revisit.
