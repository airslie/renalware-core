      # In Renalware a comorbidity is the occurrence in a patient of a particular non-renal problem
      # with life-long implications (unlike a 'problem' which the patient could recover
      # from) - e.g. the fact that that the patient has, at some point, had a heart attack.
      # Dementia is another example. This model and the table behind it define the list of
      # possible comorbidities in Renalware. Each has a snomed code which is used when reporting
      # to the UKRDC.
