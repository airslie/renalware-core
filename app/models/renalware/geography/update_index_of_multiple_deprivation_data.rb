    # Upload Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) data.
    # Extract from Consumer Data Research Centre:
    #  The Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) datasets are small area measures of relative
    #  deprivation across each of the constituent nations of the United Kingdom. Areas are ranked
    #  from the most deprived area (rank 1) to the least deprived area. Each nation publishes
    #  its data on its own data portal. Each nation measures deprivation in a slightly different
    #  way but the broad themes include income, employment, education, health, crime, barriers to
    #  housing and services, and the living environment.
    #  https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/dataset/index-multiple-deprivation-imd
    #
    # Allow a CSV file defining IMD ranks for LADs and LSOAs to be uploaded and populate the
    # associated columns in tables geography_local_authority_districts and
    # geography_lower_super_output_areas.
    # See also UpdateLocalAuthorityData which must be rune first to populate te regional data.
    # This class just augments the data and does not add any new rows.
