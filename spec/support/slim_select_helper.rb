module SlimSelectHelper
  # Capybara helper for selecting an option in a slim-select dropdown.
  # Assumption is that you have a label who's parent also contains the select list you
  # are choosing from.
  # Uses a trick to unhide the actual select box, and work with it,
  # instead of the slim_select instance, as that would both:
  # 1. Speed up tests, eliminating waits for animations
  # 2. Increase robustness, as no sleep(x), etc.
  #
  # Usage:
  #   slim_select 'Item name', from: 'Label text
  #
  def slim_select(item_text, options)
