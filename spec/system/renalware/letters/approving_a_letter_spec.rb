# A letter is approved when it has been "reviewed" by the doctor. An approved letter
# cannot be modified, and the content and visual presentation are stored permanently
# for legal purposes (archive).

# An approved letter can be viewed in a browser and downloaded as a PDF.

# A letter is considered electronically signed at the moment the user approves it.
# It can be signed by another doctor who is not assigned to the patient in the case
# the assigned doctor is absent (e.g. on vacation).
