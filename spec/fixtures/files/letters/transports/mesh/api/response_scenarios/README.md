## ITK3 Response Examples

These example scenarios are copied from
https://nhsconnect.github.io/ITK3-FHIR-Messaging-Distribution/explore_response_examples.html.
We use them in the test suite to check we are capturing the correct outcome attributes, displaying
the corect response status in the UI, and taking any neccessary action to alert users.

Each scneario has the XML which we use to stub the response, the expectation and a
description and notes.

This is a pretty verbose approach to testing repsonses, and maybe overkill, but is useful until
we fully understand the implications of each response example.
