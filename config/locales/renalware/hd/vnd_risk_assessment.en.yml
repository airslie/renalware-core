          key:
            very_low: The event is very unlikely, it will probably never happen
            low: The event is unlikely, but it could happen
            medium: The event is likely to occur
            high: The event is very likely, it is almost certain to occur
          questions:
            risk1:
              title: >-
                1. What is the likelihood that the staff (or carer) will fail to observe an actual
                or potential VND for this patient?
              narrative: >-
                The likelihood of the staff (or carer) failing to detect VND, or conditions that
                could lead to VND if not corrected, will be very low/low if staff can observe the
                patient and access easily. The likelihood will increase to medium or high if there
                are too few staff to make regular checks of the needles and if the staff are unable
                to see the access clearly due to the patient’s location, covers, poor lighting etc.
                Using a device that alarms when a VND occurs reduces this score to 0.
              note:
              options:
              - 0_very_low
              - 0_low
              - 1_medium
              - 2_high

            risk2:
              title: >-
                2. What is the likelihood that the patient will fail to raise the alarm if they
                experience VND?
              narrative: >-
                The likelihood of the patient failing to raise the alarm is very low/low if the
                patient understands the implications of VND and is sufficiently alert to take action
                if a VND, or a problem that could lead to VND, occurs. The likelihood will increase
                to medium or high if the patient sleeps during dialysis, especially if they are hard
                to wake up. It will also increase if the patient has impairments that could affect
                their ability to notice VND (such as lowered skin sensitivity or poor eyesight) or
                has communication difficulties. Using a device that alarms when a VND occurs reduces
                this score to 0.
              note:
              options:
              - 0_very_low
              - 0_low

              - 2_high
            risk3:
              title: >-
                3. What is the likelihood of the patient behaving in a way that could lead to VND?
              note: >-
                (Note: Do not consider the security of taping here, that is covered in question 4.)
              narrative: >-
                Ideally, the likelihood that a patient’s actions during dialysis will lead to VND
                will be very low. The likelihood will increase to low or medium/high if the patient
                suffers side effects (e.g. hypotension, hypoglycaemia, cramps, itching) that could
                lead to unpredictable movement, if they are restless, not fully aware of being on
                dialysis or known to tamper with the tapes, needles and/or lines. Patients who have
                had more than one unexplained needle dislodgement should score 2.
              options:
              - 0_very_low
              - 1_low
              - 2_medium
              - 2_high
            risk4:
              title: >-
                4. What is the likelihood of the taping failing to ensure that the needle is secure
                throughout dialysis?
              note: >-
                (Note: Do not consider tampering by the patient here, that is covered in
                question 3.)
              narrative: >-
                The likelihood of the taping failing to secure the needle will be very low if a
                standard taping protocol designed to prevent VND is used. The likelihood will
                increase to low or medium/high if the taping technique does not include measures
                to resist tugging on the needle tubing or has to be modified in a way that makes
                it less secure (due to allergy, steep needle angle etc), or if there are problems
                with excessive body hair, sweating or oozing from the needle site.
              options:
              - 0_very_low
              - 1_low
              - 2_medium
              - 2_high
