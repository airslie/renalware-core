# Development procfile. Run with eg

#
# Background jobs
#
# We use :async execution_mode for good_job in development and so don't need the good_job process to
# be running, but we start it anyway to let us test cron-style good_jobs which only kick off
# when using an external process.
worker: bin/good_job

#
# Javascript transpile and bundling
#
js: yarn build --watch

#
# TailwindCSS
# We could use `bundle exec app:tailwindcss:watch` rather than use yarn build:css
# but as yarn is used for the js watch, it makes sense to use it for css also.
# Note too that the build:css script in the root package json delegates to the
# build:css script in demo/package.json to mimic behaviour in site rails apps.
#
css: yarn build:css --watch
