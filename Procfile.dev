# Development procfile. Run with eg
# $ bin/dev

# Web server (puma)
#
web: bin/web -p 3000

#
# Background jobs
#
worker: bundle exec rake app:jobs:work

#
# Javascript transpile and bundling
#
js: yarn build --watch

#
# TailwindCSS
# We could use `bundle exec app:tailwindcss:watch` rather than use yarn build:css
# but as yarn is used for the js watch, it makes sense to use it for css also.
# Note too that the build:css script in the root package json delegates to the
# build:css script in spec/dummy/package.json to mimic behaviour in site rails apps.
#
css: yarn build:css --watch
