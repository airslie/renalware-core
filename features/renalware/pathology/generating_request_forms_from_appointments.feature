Feature: Generating request forms from appointments

  A clinician views a list of appointments on a given day and chooses to generate the pathology
  request forms for all of the patients on that list or for a selection of patients from the list.

  The request forms must be given in the same order as they are listed on the appointments table.

  Background:
    Given Clyde is a clinician
    And the date today is 07-06-2016
    And the following appointments:
      | starts_at_date | starts_at_time | patient            | consultant      | consultant_code | clinic     |
      | 07-06-2016     | 10:30          | Ibiere Elliott     | Emmett Eichmann | 123             | Transplant |
      | 08-06-2016     | 11:00          | Wendy Sears        | Clay Haag       | 234             | Transplant |
      | 09-06-2016     | 16:45          | Rochelle Hinsberry | Levi Considine  | 345             | Transplant |
    And the global rule sets:
      | request_description_code | BFF        |
      | clinic                   | Transplant |
      | frequency_type           | Always     |

  @web
  Scenario: A clinician generated the forms for all appointments listed
    When Clyde generates the request forms for the appointments with the following parameters:
      | param  | value      |
      | clinic | Transplant |
    Then Clyde sees the requests forms for these patients:
      | patient            |
      | Ibiere Elliott     |
      | Wendy Sears        |
      | Rochelle Hinsberry |

  @web
  Scenario: A clinician changed the order of appointments and generated the forms for all appointments listed
    When Clyde generates the request forms for the appointments sorted by user with the following parameters:
      | param  | value      |
      | clinic | Transplant |
    Then Clyde sees the requests forms for these patients:
      | patient            | consultant      | consultant_code |
      | Ibiere Elliott     | Emmett Eichmann | 123             |
      | Wendy Sears        | Clay Haag       | 234             |
      | Rochelle Hinsberry | Levi Considine  | 345             |
