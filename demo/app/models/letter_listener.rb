# This demo letter listener had been wired to receive the letter* broadcast events in the
# broadcast_subscription_map (see config/initializers/renalware.rb) and it illustrates some
# actions that can be taken after the letter has been approved/deleted.
#
# Before Letter Approve (before_letter_approved event)
# ----------------------------------------------------
# No need to take action on this event but if we feel the letter should not be approved for
# any reason, we can raise an exception to cancel the 'approve letter' transaction we are inside
# during this event.
#
# Letter Approved (letter_approved event)
# ---------------------------------------
# Note we are outside the 'approve letter' transaction here, so even if we raise an error,
# the txn will not rollback.
#
# Its worth mentioning that you might like to defer some actions into the future, to allow
# a cooling off period, eg 2 hours, within which the letter can be revoked if it was decided an
# error was made. In these instances, we will need to store the ActiveJob.id of any future-scheduled
# jobs so we can find and try them if the letter is revoked within the period. If the period has
# elapsed and the job(s) have been processed, then a replacement letter will need to be sent.
# Somewhere in the UI we need to indicate that future jobs where or where not cancelled.
#
# Examples of things we could do here for #letter_approved
# - copy the letter in to folder for later submission to CRS
# - send the letter in a HL7 or FHIR message to the hospital TIE
# - send the letter in a FHIR message to Patient Knows Best
# - send the letter to the practice via the MESH API (eg with GPConnect 'Send Document' workflow)
# - email the letter to the practice
#
# Letter Deleted (letter_deleted event)
# -------------------------------------
# Examples of things we could do here for #letter_deleted
# - cancel pending MESH transmissions
# - log or audit something
# - email an admin
# - raise an error to cancel letter deletion
