namespace :ukrdc do
  desc <<-DESC
    Creates a folder of UKRDC XML files with any changes to PV + RR patients since their last export
    Notes:
      1. Running the rake task updates the sent_to_ukrdc_at for each patient exported.
         If you don't want to do this you may need to edit this task to wrap the code in a
         transaction you can optionally roll back.
     2: If testing this inside the renalware-core gem, you will need to append app: e.g.
        app:ukrdc:export ...

    Example usage
      1. To get all RR and PKB patients with who have changed
         since the last time they were sent, or have not been sent to the UKRDC yet:

         bundle exec rake ukrdc:export

      2. To get all RR and PKB patients who have changed since a certain date:

         bundle exec rake ukrdc:export changed_since="2018-02-23"

      3. To get only certain RR and PKB patients (by their id eg ids 1 and 2) with changes since
         a certain date:

         bundle exec rake ukrdc:export changed_since=2018-02-23 patient_ids=1,2
