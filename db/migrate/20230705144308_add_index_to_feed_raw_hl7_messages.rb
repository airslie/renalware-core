          We query for rows ordering by created_at asc to give us a chance to procsess in FIFO order,
          so having an ordered index means when we use a LIMIT (batching) in the query, rows will
          be determined by index scan without having to look to the end of the table -
          or something like that! In fact the index is implcitly ordered already but having
          created_at: :asc here makes our intention more explicit.
