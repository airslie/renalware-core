    # However we also want to allow historical duplicates - there can be
    # many of the same patient+user combination as long as they have a different
    # deleted_at datetime. Because NULLs don't help in the index for our un-deleted
    # scenario (deleted_at == NULL) we have to coalesce those NULLs into the same
    # valid date. This lets us have a unique index when deleted_at is NULL.
