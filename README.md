# Renalware

Renalware uses demographic, clinical, pathology, and nephrology datasets to 
improve patient care, undertake clinical and administrative audits and share 
data with external systems.

## Technical Overview

`renalware-core` is an open-source Ruby On Rails [engine](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/engines.html)
that encapsulates Renalware's features in a re-usable [gem](http://guides.rubygems.org/what-is-a-gem/).

In order to deploy an instance of Renalware that is tailored to a
renal unit's needs, it is necessary to create a new host Rails application that 
includes the `renalware-core` gem, adds configuration and HTML/JavaScript/CSS 
overrides, and optionally augments or replaces core behaviour with custom Ruby 
code.

While `renalware-core` is intended to be deployed inside a host application in 
production, it can be run stand-alone in a local development environment using 
the _demo_ host application (`./demo`) that ships inside the engine.

Renalware is built using using open source projects including:
- Ruby on Rails framework
- PostgreSQL database
